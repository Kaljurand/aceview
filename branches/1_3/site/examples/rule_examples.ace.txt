/**

This a list of ACE sentences that translate into SWRL rules.
Note that the SWRL rule support in APE is experimental and
incomplete. The main problem is that sometimes rules are
created which syntactically violate the DLSafe rules but
which could be turned into legal rules with a few changes
that do not affect the semantics.

If a dog is taller than a cat that is taller than a mouse then the dog is taller than the mouse.

If a man sees a woman then a dog sees a cat. /* Not allowed in DLSafe */

Every man that owns a car and that is not a manager cleans the car.

If John likes Mary then John is a man and Mary is a woman.

If John likes Mary then Ann likes Bill.

If X loves Y and Y loves X then X is a man.

# The following two rules turn the text inconsistent
# provided that "John likes Mary.".

If John likes Mary then Bill is William.

If John likes Mary then Bill is not William.


If 1 + 2 < 4 then John does not like Mary.

# Pellet says:
# WARNING: IGNORING RULE Rule([equal([?xg6, ?xg7]), multiply([?xg6, ?x1, ?x2]), multiply([?xg7, ?x2, ?x1])] => [know(Brian,Brian)]): Could not generate safe ordering for body constraints.

If X * Y = Y * X then Brian knows itself.



# Pellet says:
# WARNING: Ignoring rule Rule([add([?xg3, "1"^^integer, "2"^^integer]), equal([?x1, ?xg3])] => [equal([?x1, "4"^^integer])]): Builtin atoms in rule heads are not currently supported

If X = 1 + 2 then X = 4.


For everything John likes Mary.

If there is X and there is Y then X knows Y.

If "12" & "34"= "1234" then John owns at most 5 cars.


# Reasoning with stringConcat.
# Currently doesn't work because Pellet says:
# WARNING: IGNORING RULE Rule([name(?x2,?xg1), name(?x6,?xg3), stringConcat([?xg1, ?xg2, ?x4]), stringConcat([?xg2, ?x3, " "^^string]), stringConcat([?xg3, ?xg4, ?x7]), stringConcat([?xg4, ?x3, " "^^string])] => [namesake(?x2,?x6)]): Could not generate safe ordering for body constraints.
If X's name is F & " " & A1 and Y's name is F & " " & A2 then X is a namesake of Y.

John1's name is "John Smith".

John2's name is "John Jones".

Whose namesake is John1?

Whose namesake is John2?


# Doing calculations in SWRL.
# Doesn't work because "value" is translated as an object property.

If X = 1 + 2 then Number's value is X.

What is Number's value?


# Rule with no builtins nor data properties.
# Creates an extra variable into the head and is
# thus not accepted by HermiT.

Every territory
	that is surrounded by a country X
	and
	that is a part of a country Y
		that is not X
	is an enclave.


# Simple rule with builtins but no classes/properties/individuals/variables.

If 1 + 2 = 3 then 1 = 3 - 2.


# Simple rule with a variable.
# Currently translated incorrectly.

If 1 + 2 = X then X = 3.


# Complex rule about the relationship between every circle's radius and area.
# Note however that currently "radius" and "area" are incorrectly
# treated as object properties.

If there is a circle C and C's radius is R and C's area is S then S = Pi * (R * R) / 1 + 2 - 2.
