* The goal of this text to describe some aspects of the European Union
* completely (e.g. we list all the countries). We also cover NATO and G8 membership.
* The main focus is on bordering information.
*
* Since the idea is to demonstrate reasoning with this text, we have to
* be careful so that reasoning is reasonably fast. Thus we avoid certain useful
* but "slow" constructs (e.g. "There are exactly 27 EU-countries.").
*
* TODO:
* other cool stuff formalize/entail:
* - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_that_border_only_one_other_country
* - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sets_of_four_countries_that_border_one_another
* - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_land_border_lengths

* BUG: For some reason this is not entailed:
* #@entails "Liechtenstein is a doubly-landlocked-territory." under OWL
