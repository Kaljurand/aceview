#a) Create the following class hierarchy:
# ParentClass
#     ClassA

Every woman is a person.

# b) Define an object property: 'hasRelation'

# c) Define a restriction for ClassA: 'hasRelation some ClassB'
Every man likes a woman.

#d) Create two individuals,
#one for ClassA ('individualClassA') and one for ClassB ('individualClassB')

John is a man.

Mary is a woman.

#e) Define a property assertion for
#individualClassA: 'hasRelation individualClassB'
John likes Mary.

#f) Similar for individualClassB: 'hasRelation individualClassA'
Mary likes John.

/*
Now, using the DL Query (or creating defined classes), try the
following DL assertions:
*/

#1) ClassA and (hasRelation some ClassB) -- works fine
Which man likes a woman?

#2) ClassB and (hasRelation some ClassA) -- works fine
Which woman likes a man?

#3) ClassA and (hasRelation some ParentClass) -- works fine
Which man likes a person?

#4) ClassB and (hasRelation some ParentClass) -- works fine
Which woman likes a person?

#5) ParentClass and (hasRelation some ClassA) -- works fine
Which person likes a man?

#6) ParentClass and (hasRelation some ClassB) -- cannot find individualClassA
Which person likes a woman?

#7) ParentClass and (hasRelation some ParentClass) -- cannot find individualClassA
Which person likes a person?
