/**

This a list of ACE sentences that translate into SWRL rules.
Note that the SWRL rule support in APE is experimental and
incomplete. The main problem is that sometimes rules are
created which syntactically violate the DLSafe rules but
which could be turned into legal rules with a few changes
that do not affect the semantics.

# Complex rule about the relationship between every circle's radius and area.
# Note however that currently "radius" and "area" are incorrectly
# treated as object properties.

If there is a circle C and C's radius is R and C's area is S then S = Pi * (R * R) / 1 + 2 - 2.
