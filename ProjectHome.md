**ACE View** is a natural language based
ontology and rule editor. ACE View uses [Attempto Controlled English (ACE)](http://attempto.ifi.uzh.ch) in the front-end, and
[Web Ontology Language (OWL)](http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/) and [Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL)](http://www.w3.org/Submission/SWRL/)
in the back-end. ACE View has been implemented as a plug-in for Protégé 4.
