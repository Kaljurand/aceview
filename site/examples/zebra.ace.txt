# Describing three types of ordered items
#
# 1 Those that can follow or be followed by at most one item
# 1.1 Those that can only be followed by (first item)
# 1.2 Those that can only follow (last item)
#
Every ordered-item follows at most 1 ordered-item and is followed by at most 1 ordered-item.

Every first-item is an ordered-item that follows no ordered-item and is followed by an ordered-item.

Every last-man is a man that is a last-item.

Every middle-man is a man.
Every middle-man follows a man that follows a first-man.
# Not needed because logically redundant:
#Every middle-man is followed by a man that is followed by a last-man.

/*
The puzzle can be made a bit harder (but the answer remains the same)
by replacing the above sentence with this:

There is a man X1 that has White.
There is a man X2 that has Green.
X1 follows X2 or is followed by X2.

This doesn't seem to increase the reasoner (Hermit) runtime though.
