<p>ACE View is an ontology and rule editor that uses Attempto Controlled English (ACE)
in order to create, view and edit OWL ontologies and SWRL rulesets.

<p><b>Version 1.3.0</b> (for Protege 4.1 Build 213+).
Release date: 2010-11-09</p>

<p>This version works with Protege 4.1, and is <b>not</b>
compatible with any earlier version of Protege.</p>

<p>Note that ACE View 1.3.x should be considered a development branch, some features
present in 1.2.x are not available here yet.</p>

<p>Update URL:
<a href="http://aceview.googlecode.com/svn/branches/1_3/update.properties">http://aceview.googlecode.com/svn/branches/1_3/update.properties</a>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>ADDED: New preference "Use the lexicon of morphological annotations" (ON by default), which can be switched
	OFF in order not to generate morph annotations to OWL entities. In this case each
	entity must be referenced from an ACE sentence via its lemma form.
	This might be useful when loading exisitng OWL ontologies where entity names are not standard English words.</li>
	<li>ADDED: Q&amp;A View has now a checkbox "Search answers" if set then highlights/shows only the questions whose _answer_ contains the selected entity. (By default shows the questions that contain the selected entity.)</li>
	<li>ADDED: Action "Annotate every axiom with ACE text".</li>
	<li>ADDED: Some additional examples to the documentation page.</li>
	<li>IMPROVED: Loading ontologies with lots of data property axioms is now faster.</li>
	<li>IMPROVED: Q&amp;A View now shows structured entities as answers, e.g. equivalent classes
	are grouped together.</li>
	<li>IMPROVED: ACE Word Usage View now displays more information about the entity itself
	(IRI, rendering, annotations).</li>
	<li>UPDATED: all external libraries.</li>
	<li>CHANGED: Not annotating the axioms anymore with ACE text when the axioms are added,
	but there is a new Action which can be used e.g. before saving the ontology.</li>
	<li>REMOVED: AceWiki export. Will be added back in a future version.</li>
</ul>



<p><b>Version 1.2.20</b> (Protege 4.0.113 (r14610, OWL API 2.2.1.1138)).
Release date: 2009-06-22</p>

<ul>
	<li>IMPROVED: In ACETextViewComponent, replaced SwingWorker with the new Protege
	BackgroundTask. This gives a nicer integration with Protege.</li>
	<li>IMPROVED: Removed the path of the SWI-Prolog executable from
	the preferences and the preferences panel.
	This is not needed as libjpl knows this path.</li>
	<li>IMPROVED: pretty-printing of Saxon genitives
	(e.g. Polyneikes'child -> Polyneikes' child)</li>
	<li>CHANGED: The toString-serialization of an ACE text is now a \n\n-connected
	toString-serializations of its snippets. The ACE text view reflects this,
	i.e. no longer are <em>sentences</em> added and removed in this view. Instead,
	<em>snippets</em> are added and removed.
	This aligns nicely with the new paragraph support in ACE/APE 6.5.</li>
	<li>CHANGED: Renamed: ace:Superman -> ace:Universe; ace:know -> ace:contain.
	(These entities are generated in the background to capture the semantics
	of sentences like "There are exactly 27 EU-countries.")</li>
	<li>FIXED: Some preferences were not remembered</li>
	<li>UPDATED: google-collect to v1.0 RC2</li>
	<li>UPDATED: swingx to v1.0</li>
</ul>



<p><b>Version 1.2.19</b> (Protege 4.0.110 (r13753, OWL API 2.2.1.1090)).
Release date: 2009-04-15</p>

<ul>
	<li>IMPROVED: Snippet-table tooltips</li>
	<li>IMPROVED: "Declare complete" dialog</li>
	<li>FIXED: Snippet table filtering was based on regexp matching which meant that
	if you clicked on `work-for' then "John works-for Mary." was not shown in the
	filtering mode. Now filtering is based on whether the snippet references
	an entity or not.</li>
	<li>FIXED: Problems with hiding and reordering table columns</li>
	<li>FIXED: Added <em>equals</em> and <em>hashCode</em> to <em>ACESnippetImpl</em>.
	This fixed a regression in the entailment tracking, and
	probably several other regressions as well.</li>
	<li>UPDATED: google-collect</li>
	<li>UPDATED: swingx</li>
</ul>



<p><b>Version 1.2.18</b> (Protege 4.0.109+ (r13523, OWL API 2.2.1.1070)).
Release date: 2009-03-26</p>

<p>The ACE View source code is now available from:
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/aceview/">http://code.google.com/p/aceview/</a>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>ADDED: Completeness checking for sub class answers.</li>
	<li>ADDED: Confirmation dialog for completeness assertion.</li>
	<li>ADDED: Tooltips for the cells in the snippets table.</li>
	<li>REPLACED: lexicon.jar with simplenlg-v37.jar (the latter includes lexicon.jar,
	and lexicon.jar is not available anymore in any other way).</li>
	<li>FIXED: Some highlighting/reordering related problems in the tables.</li>
	<li>FIXED: ACE View didn't reflect SWRL rules being edited, now pops up an error
	(preliminary solution).</li>
	<li>Some code cleanup.</li>
</ul>



<p><b>Version 1.2.17</b> (Protege 4.0.109 (r13181, OWL API 2.2.1.1042)).
Release date: 2009-03-01</p>

<ul>
<li>ADDED: highlighter for individual-answer completeness</li>
<li>ADDED: customized axiom annotation panel (without Manchester Syntax rendering).
Previously used Protege's axiom annotation panel,
but this did not load properly anymore at ACE View startup.</li>
</ul>



<p><b>Version 1.2.16</b> (Protege 4.0.108 (r12625, OWL API 2.2.1.974)).
Release date: 2009-02-17</p>

<ul>
<li>ADDED (experimental): in Q&amp;A View: The label "Answer is complete" is added to the set of
individual-answers, in case the set is complete
(no new individual can show up as part of the answer unless an existing axiom
is modified/deleted).
If the answer is not complete, then a button shows up, allowing the user to declare that the answer is complete.</li>
<li>ADDED: in Q&amp;A View: now translating an unsatisfiable question (e.g. "Which dog is a cat?",
provided that "No dog is a cat.") into a snippet ("Nothing is a dog that is a cat.")
and showing it together with a "Why?" button in the answers pane.</li>
<li>IMPROVED: Updating the answers automatically after classification is now optional</li>
<li>IMPROVED: Updating the answers now runs in the background, the progress is reported, and
the task can be cancelled.</li>
<li>IMPROVED: The auto-completer now returns a sorted set (sorted case-insensitively)</li>
<li>IMPROVED: The GUI a bit (nicer buttons, nicer answers pane)</li>
<li>UPDATED: to google-collect-snapshot-20090211</li>
<li>Lots of minor bug fixes, cleanup of the code and Javadoc</li>
</ul>



<p><b>Version 1.2.15</b> (Protege 4.0.107 (r12557, OWL API 2.2.1.972)).
Release date: 2009-01-16</p>

<ul>
<li>ADDED: "Annotate" button to Snippet Editor. Launches the standard Protege axiom annotation
editor to allow the annotation of the axiom that corresponds to the selected snippet.</li>
<li>FIXED: Data properties are now taken into account when generating AceWiki format</li>
<li>IMPROVED: now using Swing Worker for background jobs</li>
<li>UPDATED: to SwingX 0.9.5</li>
</ul>



<p><b>Version 1.2.14</b> (Protege b104+ (r12512, OWL API r969)).
Release date: 2008-12-22</p>

<ul>
<li>ADDED: Action "Export as AceWiki ..." which saves the ACE text in AceWiki format</li>
<li>ADDED: Action "Update answers" which recalculates the answers to all the questions.
Previously this was done automatically after classification.</li>
<li>ADDED: Clicking on an OWL logical axiom or SWRL rule
in a Protege view selects the corresponding ACE snippet,
which is then shown in the Snippet Editor and Feedback views.</li>
<li>IMPROVED: Action "Fill lexicon" is now about 5x faster</li>
</ul>



<p><b>Version 1.2.13</b> (Protege b104 (r12284, OWL API r962)).
Release date: 2008-11-26</p>

<ul>
<li>Now updatable via the P4 plug-in update system</li>
<li>ADDED: "Why?" button to Snippet Editor. Triggers an explanation of the selected snippet,
if the reasoner is switched on. For an asserted snippet, it provides a way to find out
if the snippet is logically redundant. This is marked by the existence of more
than one explanation.</li>
<li>ADDED: Similar snippets list to Feedback view. Shows snippets that are
similar (contain the same content words) to the selected snippet.</li>
<li>ADDED: Explanation view (previously was included in Entailments View)</li>
<li>ADDED: Some ACE View related links to the Help-menu</li>
<li>IMPROVED: Q&amp;A view: Clicking on an answer generates a full answer into the Snippet Editor.
E.g. for the question "Which EU-country borders a NATO-country?"
and the answer "Estonia", the full answer
is "Estonia is a EU-country that borders a NATO-country.".
This generated snippet can be explained by clicking on the Snippet Editor's "Why?" button.</li>
<li>IMPROVED: ACE View preferences panel</li>
<li>CHANGED: The default OWL-to-ACE service is now accessible via the standard port 80.</li>
<li>FIXED: All views were reacting to the selected snippet event. For many
views this was unnecessary and slowed down browsing large ontologies.</li>
</ul>



<p><b>Version 1.2.12</b> (Protege b103 (r11714, OWL API r941))</p>

<ul>
<li>ADDED: More metrics</li>

<li>ADDED: Possibility to configure the location of SWI and APE</li>

<li>ADDED: Entailment view can now generate snippet selection events</li>

<li>CHANGED: Disabled ACEWordformViewComponent as it
wasn't compatible with Protege build 102 ("quote problem" in entity surface form annotations)</li>

<li>CHANGED: Improved the layout, gave more prominence to the Snippet Editor and Feedback</li>

<li>FIXED: Several performance problems</li>

<li>FIXED: Some UI problems</li>

<li>CLEANUP: Lexicon handling</li>
</ul>



<p><b>Version 1.2.11</b> (Protege r11368, before build 101).
Release date: 2008-09-29</p>

<ul>
<li>ADDED: new view: ACE Snippet Editor</li>

<li>ADDED: Auto-completion to ACE Snippet Editor and ACE Text view</li>

<li>ADDED: possibility to view the rdfs:comment axiom annotation in the ACE Snippet Editor
and the number of comments in the ACE Snippets view</li>

<li>ADDED: URI to Snippet table model</li>

<li>REMOVED: Add/Delete View, Debug View, Inferences View</li>

<li>REMOVED: Details-pane from ACE Snippets view</li>

<li>CHANGED: ACE lexicon: lemma is now completely independent from the surface forms,
lemma corresponds to an OWL entity, surface forms determine how
to verbalize this entity</li>

<li>CHANGED: ACE Words view now shows all the entities, even those that are not used
in any ACE snippet. The rendering respects the current entity rendering choice.</li>

<li>FIXED: handling of annotations whose value is not a constant (like in OBI)</li>

<li>FIXED: all views now respect the font that is set in the preferences</li>

<li>UPDATED: to SwingX 0.9.4</li>
</ul>
