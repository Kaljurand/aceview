John1 has at most 3 apples.

John2 has at most 3 apples that are a red.

John3 has at most 3 apples that he likes.


# John1
Who has at most 3 apples?

# John2, John1
Who has at most 3 apples that are a red?

# Not possible in OWL/DL-Query because the
# reference 'he' tries to access something beyond apples. ;(
# should be: John3, John1
Who has at most 3 apples that he likes?


# Since the general question does not work, we have to ask
# for every individual separately. We do this by classification
# and then ask for the members of this class.

If John1 has at most 3 apples that he likes then John1 is an answer.

If John2 has at most 3 apples that he likes then John2 is an answer.

If John3 has at most 3 apples that he likes then John3 is an answer.

# John3, John1
Who is an answer?
