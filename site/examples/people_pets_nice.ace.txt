This is the automatic ACE verbalization of the people+pets ontology
with some manual post-editing, namely:

deleted: If something X is-part-of something Y then Y has-part X.
deleted: If something X has-part something Y then Y is-part-of X.
deleted: If something X eats something Y then Y eaten-by X.
deleted: If something X eaten-by something Y then Y eats X.
deleted: If something X has-pet something Y then Y is-pet-of X.
deleted: If something X is-pet-of something Y then Y has-pet X.
deleted: Tom is something. (and other similar assertions)
changed: is-part-of -> is a part of
changed: is-pet-of -> is a pet of
changed: has-pet -> 's pet is; whose pet is, ...
changed: is has-pet by -> is a pet of
changed: is has-mother by -> is a mother of
changed: has-pet was renamed to has-as-pet if it was used with plural noun phrases (at least N, nothing but, ...)
changed: Every newspaper is something that is a broadsheet or that is a tabloid. (rephrased without 'something', there was one other similar change)
added: sentences linking has-as-pet and 'is a pet of'
changed: The42 service-number 42. -> The42's service-number is 42.
changed: something X -> X (the new version of the verbalizer does this as well)

Note that this text can be parsed with APE's built-in common words' lexicon Clex
and using guessing. There is no need for a user lexicon, i.e. unknown wordforms
are already in their lemma form and need no further morphological analysis
(e.g. although 'cat-liker' is an unknown form, it is already in singular, and
forms like 'eaten' which need to be transformed into 'eat' can be dealt with because
Clex knows about them).
