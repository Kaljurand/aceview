/**

Part of the description of the Zebra Problem.
Description of a street with 5 houses.

Note that we do not have to assert that the individuals
House1 ... House5 are all different. This is taken care of
by the constraints.

pellet-2.0.0-rc3 spends 50 seconds on classifying this tiny ontology (on a G4 laptop).

HermiT 0.9.2 did it in 3 seconds.
