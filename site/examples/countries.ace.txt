*
* The goal of this text to describe some aspects of the European Union
* completely (e.g. we list all the countries).
* We also cover NATO and G8 membership.
*
* Since the idea is to demonstrate reasoning with this text, we have to
* be careful so that reasoning is reasonably fast. Thus we avoid certain useful
* but "slow" constructs (e.g. "There are exactly 27 EU-countries.").
*
* TODO: use `itself' again, the "not(self(..))" bug seems to be fixed in Pellet 2
