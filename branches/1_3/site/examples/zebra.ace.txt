#
# 1 Those that can follow or be followed by at most one item
# 1.1 Those that can only be followed by (first item)
# 1.2 Those that can only follow (last item)

/*
The puzzle can be made a bit harder (but the answer remains the same)
by replacing the above sentence with this:

There is a man X1 that has White.
There is a man X2 that has Green.
X1 follows X2 or is followed by X2.

This doesn't seem to increase the reasoner (Hermit) runtime though.
